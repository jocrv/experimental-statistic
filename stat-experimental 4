Cluster Sampling: 
Understand basic concept for cluster sampling by conglomerates and aspects about this select for one, two or multiple stages. Variables for interested, with the average, and total; coefficient of correlation with conglomerates; one particular case of sampling for conglomerates and systematic sampling. Propose: understand the characteristic of techniques of cluster sampling to estimate the quantity of interested on search. Presents the expressions using toe this estimate and coefficient of correlation intraclass. Present a particular case for cluster sample, in this case sistematic sampling. Preparation: Before begins this content, certified to go along examples and demonstration. Goals: module 1. apply the concept to sampling for cluster for one or more stages comparison with differents sampling plans of select unit for sample. Module 2: apply estatistic expression in estimate of quantity of interested accordig to sampling cluster include the coefficient with correlation intraclass. Module 3: describe the sampling of sistematic select for estimate sampling
Module 1: apply the concept of cluster sampling for one or more stages, comparing differents sample plans for select the units of sample.  Toe that impacts contourne this problem, can used the cluster sampling. This module analyse this type of selection to sampling of cluster. See the Advantages to do the cluster on population and hot toe that. Besides that, study the selection for sampling cluster on more than one level. Stars this level and after that the selection on multiple stages. How to create groups on sample before do this sampling. 
1. Motivation for cluster sampling: The cost of search is variable and extremely important at moment to define the stages of planning. Probabily this person who contract the serach doesn't know nothing about sample plan, methods of select, estimate or error margin. More than what he want, is save money. // This challenge is bigger in the pratical way because convince someone to do X beasied Y is cheaper but could be complicated. Because of this is important to explain and leaving the cliente choose multiple scenarios of this sampling. When you do that, from differents sampling, using differents levels of confidence G = 90% G=95% G= 99% and the error values too E= 1% E=3% E=5% Explain the impact of recult could cause to using one scenario or another. To help solve this problem with this complexicity, the cluster sampling (CS) could be useful. Another time are available refresh register to analyse units, but the investigate from unit from this population could be difficult because the same could find the dispersion in the real life, impact higher cousts to collect and wait the obtain of data. Depends of the case, the same register from this population could be definy,e and updated data. Depends of the case, the register from this population had been definied,e and updated could be higher coust to select sample among the simple random sample (SRS) or stratified sampling (SS). SRS: In this case you select from a aleatory list had been use with replacement or without replacement. It's meand any unit could be a part of the sample and the problem increase if just one element far away from each other be select. It'll coust high price to change the place to find only one quixx, that's not enough. That characteristic is undesire in simple random sample.   SS: in this one to construct natural strata or statistics but for each strata constructed you need to select one sample inside. So if have 1000 stratas, have to select a samplefor each one of 1000 stratas. If you dont have any limitation of time or budget thats ok, if this happen whcih alternative we have? At this point to get int the cluster of sample, imagine divide your population in groups but without been necessary select sample for one of this groups as AE, and you are not so depent fro randomixxed distance for each unit, as SRS. First select randomic some groups after that obtain your sample. In this way the model of cluster sampling have to do this investigate for groups of units in cluster, besides investigate in isolation every simple simple unit how occur in models with simple random and stratification sample. 
2. comparing of stratification sampling and cluster sampling:  the of the sample plan by cluster remember, in certain way, the stratification sampling. In both cases, we divide the population on sets. Once this part are the same, but the difference starts appears. 1. stratification: the stratification is more indicated when groups who are formed intern more homogeneous between each other. Means, in theory, the variability inside the strata gonna be less which means the variability among stratas been bigger (if the variability is smaller inside, she had been bigger outside). In case of SS we need guarantee the select of sample for each strata, doesn't matter how strata exists. 2. Cluster: in cluster the premise is the group formed from population had to be in the certain way similar each other, because of thta doesn't have to be different to select one group or another. The idea are sample elements have to be distributed in groups and doesn't exist individuals with characteristic more particular in just one group. Wainting the cluster select can be select for all population. That meand, more Heterogenous inside cluster more efficient for sample procedure. That's exaclty opposite required on stratification sample. According to Bolfarine (2005) when more similar are the elements inside one cluster, less efficient is the procedure. The result is expect, because the cluster have to more representative from universe, it have to be a micro representation from itself, it means the all type of participaticion, not only one type of the same way. Because of that, we said the opposite is expect from SS. Besides that the methods are divide from population groups (that means strata or cluster) the techniques are completely differents. 
3. Concept about cluster sampling: in this type of sampling, the population units are grouped in clusters. In this situations, is possible define groups among units to analyse how close they are each other. The using of this grouped as unit for sampling possibility increase how fast collect and dicrease the cost of this investigate without big loss of efficiency. // when are not available the register for unit analysed (people, home, employeeson a industry, establishment, comercial etc) the obtain and update for this register become a problem when the subject is the cost. It's possiblr the time necesary to update are longer than expect and affects surveys. Disposing from register, which this units are grouped as example: census sectors, census demographic, census economic, register from industry. survey to update this unit, agglomerated is less easir the realixxation to update sample statistics. For example: a population divide 6 groups, that means 6 conglomerates(could be 6 region) each unit inside this conglomeratesis the unit of population. In this case, the sample unit is not each element, and become as conglomerates as all of them( example: regions, states, districts, families, houses, schools). In this way each conglomerates has more than one populacional element. According to Bolfarine (2005) it features well sample planning for conglomerates and the sample unit is more then one populacional element. Step by step. step 1: in this first step using the sample plan is define the conglomerates. Need to find a characteristic allow to separate this population for any groups mutual and exclusive (distinct) and exaustive (all individual have to been insert in a group) in this way doesn't exist any different non aleatory of other groups.
4. Advantages and desadvantages of cluster sampling:  we can said the most Advantages for this method is select between operational part, implies consequentelli dicrease costs. Select conglomerates and investigate the population inside is cheaper than other methods of sampling. Example: One election search, for example, of some country with continential dimensions could be more complicated. The AC could be extremely advantage, because image doing one selection in all country. The best things is separet the population in groups and select a parte for study. Besides that, using the geographic clusters could lower costs for search. The most advantage for this type of selection is conglomerates been more homogeneous internal. That's too bad for search, because if the elements inside the cluster are so similar, the sample plan result in some problems at moment of analyses statistic, because presented increase variance. Inside the same conglomerates of unit trend have more values similar (high correlation) in respect of a lot of variables from this search. This fenomeny  trends to do more sample plan of this kindy been less efficiency. 
5. Cluster sampling in stages: at least now are you studying how to created cluster for using this sample plan. But, sample cluster are not only this. this allos how to use a lot of stages after this select. We see nos how we can do this in practical way. 
5.1 Sampling cluster in only just stage: this is a kindy of sample cluster. First of all, define the cluster and after that select the sample according to the sample plan ( simple random sample). So, first the group after select the RSR, named simple sample for cluster. For cluster select all the elements belonging to this cluster will be part of sample. In this case, we don't define the sixxe of sample, but the quantity of cluster after that select cluster for all individuals inside the interviews. In the figure 3 the population are divide in 6 groups, in 3 groups was select randomic (paint with yellow). So the moment for this was realixxed the sample cluster in stage 1 said all individual inside will be select, doesn't matter how exists. Theory in pratical way: imagine one search to estimated the familiar income of students average of determine city. Consider the sampling to cluster in one stage, which steps are using to find this result of this research? to solve this question frist divide the town in school districts. It means each district will conglomerates. Done this, we have to select some of conglomerates and ask about familiar income for each students. In that way the sample of unit is obtain select sample for conglomerates include all unit in conglomerates select ( sample cluste on 1 stage with SCS1) 
5.2 Sampling with cluster in two stages: maybe you are thinking: how to select this individuals? why not select just one? if you think about this onSC on two stages. In this case, after select a cluster, we need to select individual inside all cluster. so we dont need the sixxe for each cluster, so we can control all cost to select the search. In this figure 4 shows SC in two stages, first of all had been select with clusters (2,3 and 4) after that just some units had been select random select with SRS. Named this case sampling with cluster in two stages ou just SCS2.
5.3 Sampling with clusters on multiple stages:  this terminology are using to select data and said about unit of sampling. This first itens are using to sampling named unit to primary sampling (PS), the second one named secondary unit sampling (SUS ) the third level named tertiary unit for sampling (TUS). The sample of multiples stages are unfoldings of units selection by levels before. Imagine one schollar search in one district. First of all, one school are defined with a cluster in some of them are selected. Then, in this raffle, selection students at class, as saw in figure 5. On figure 5, first select the school will do the part of search (1 and 3) after the class from schools (class 2 at school 1 class 25 at school 3). Then, we do the select to student inside in class. So, we got: primary unit sampling(PUS): school secondary unit of Sampling(SUS): class tertiary unit of sampling(TUS): students // to summarie we got 3 stages: step1:sample of PS select Step2: select sample to SUS for each one PS select at first step. Step 3: sample of elemetary unit select from one of this TUS select. Some author using the term of elementary unit for the last level of sampling. So, in this case, students were called Elementary Unit. In this example we said 3 stages, so this have to be big for former groups. We can select statesl, after cities in this states, neighbohood, individual, houses. So we have sampling for cluster in 5 stages, and states of PS and individuais in all elementary units.   
Example1: The cluster sampling is a method using a method for sample select. In relation of cluster sampling is correct for the cluster be better represents of universe, so it have be a micro representation of itself, it means, had all participaticion. In this random sampling we waint groups of Heterogenous elements inside cluster to obtain representation of population. in this way to terms this representation we need to all type of elements for population sample. 
example2: consider the sampling theory analyse: 1. at simple stratification sample, the population is divide of strata (examples: gender, salary), and simple random sample is using the select of sample for each strata. II. In cluster sampling in general is less efficiency the simple random sample and stratification sampling, on the other hand is more cheap. III. at simple random sample, select sequency for each sample unit with equal probability, for every sample had the same chance to be choose. The select have to done with or without replacement. All this are correct. In simple stratification sample, the population is divide on stratas and SRS is using to selecr one of sample for each strata. At cluster sampling population is divide in clusters of subpopulation distincts. Some of cluster are select according to SRS and all individual in clusters select are observing. In general, is less efficience of SRS or SS on the other hand is more cheapir. On simple random sample select sequency for each sample unit with equal probability; each sample had the same chance to ve choose. The selection could be done with or without replacement. 
Module 2: apply the statistic expressions for estimation of quantity of interested according to the cluster sampling, include the coefficient of correlation intraclass. Before this we saw the concept related with cluster sampling, with advantage and Disadvantages and some comparison among sample plans.On this module, we need to study how to do estimated qauntity of interested based on plan to cluster sample. First we see the notations and basic defnitions, after that using all mathematics expressions to do estimation on sampling theory. Finally we studyed the correlaction of interclass and how it affect the efficiency for cluster sample plan.
5.4 Basic notation and estimation: the cluster sampling  are udes to one specific notation on estimation process. remember we desire to know this population, but it's difficult to work with all. That populational variables are interested to study, but aren't knowing, we named parameters. Our goal to this sample is try to estimate this populational parameters. For example, the average for average of some variable to interested that populational is a parameter, so it's dificult try your new populational value, and, we need to do this sample to estimate the average. The theory of estimation SC in multiple stages changes by the way the number of units from sampling increase, but the basic part is the same. We saw on estimation for sampling the cluster in stage 1. The notation using is given by: One identifier i to represents the cluster which one it's belongs. The identifier j to represents the variable of refeer. The value for any variable from search named yij, it means, we are refeering tha sampling value from a variable j from cluster i. The population sixxe from a cluster which one is definied as N, the sampling sixxe from a cluster given by n. Each element inside of cluster is identify by Mi. So, to find the unit of population sixxe just add all unit from all clusters: M0= Σi=1 **N MI   | In case to sample, the quantity of individuals m0 is done add the individuals from cluster select, as:  m0= Σi=1**n Mi Notice the total in general represents by M in capital letter on populatiom (M0) and the tiny letter in sample(mo). On notation from SC, the parameter from population have capital letter and the estimation of sample has tiny letter. 
5.5 Population Parameter: 1. total of cluster: Yi=  Σj=1**Mi Yij where Yij is the value of variable from search to unit j from cluster i  2. average of cluster i: Yi = Yi/Mi =  Σ j=1 **Mi Yij/Mi // 3. population total: Y =  Σi=1**N Yi // 4. cluster average: Yc= Y/N=  Σj=1**Mi Yij/N  //5. average for unit: Y= Y/M0 =  Σ i=1**N Yi/M0 // At least from population, select one sample from cluster by SRS, inside the N which exists. With this we used the sample data to do estimation like:
Object with interaction: 
1. Total of cluster i in sample i=1,...,n : yi=  Σ j=1**mi Yij where Yij is the sample value of variable searching for unit j of cluster i 
2. average of cluste i from sample, i= 1, ...,n : Yi= Yi/Mi =  Σ j=1**Mi Yij/Mi
3. Total of sample: Y=  Σ i=1**n Yi 
4. average cluster: Yc= t/n=  Σ i=1**n Yi/n 
5. average of unit: y= t/m0=  Σ i=1**n yi/  Σ i=1**n Mi 
6. Probability of cluster inclusion: P= n/N
7. Probability of unit from inclusion: P= n/N 
How in SCS selecting cluster by SRS after search the unit, it's natural for the probability of inclusion for cluster and the probability for inclusion of units been equals. Ownership this sample values we can finally do this estimation include this sixxe for variance: 
estimate the average: y= Y/M0= N/M0  Σ i=1**n Yi/n = yc/M  This expression we used to do the estimation average from one variable in SC. In terms of variability, we got this expression for variance: 1. Population variance from average estimation: ˆV ACS(y) = 1/M**2 (1-1n/N)/n S**2 Using ^ to estimation of sample data 2. ˆV acs(y) = 1/M**2 (1-1n/N)/n s**2 where s**2=  Σ i=1**n(yi-yc)**2/(n-1) Besides that, the standard error of average variance is given by: Ep(V acs(y)) = √V acs(y) = √1/M**2 (1-n/N/n) s**2  At the same way we do this average we can estimate the populacional total: 2. Estimation of population total: ˆY = N/n Σi=1 **n Yi = Nyc= Σi=1**n Σj=1**Mi wij yij /// when wij= N/n are the weight individuals, it means, the inverse of the probabilities to select (n/N). 3. Variance of population from total estimation: Vacs(Y) = N**2(1-n/N)/n S**2  // no we used ^ to do the estimation for sample data. 4. Estimation of variance from total estimation: Vac(^Y) = N**2( 1- n/N)/n s**2   where s**2= Σ i=1**n (yi-yc) **2/ (n-1)  Besides the the standard error of estimation from total variance ig given by: Ep(Vacs(Y)) == √ Vacs(Y) = √N**2 (1-n/N)/n s**2 // Now, understand the estimation of SC using the pratical way will be better. Like, if estimate the number Y of unit rents in company apartment complex were compact in 270 areas ( squares, blocks ) you can select simple random sample of 20 in this areas and determine, from interview methods in all units, the number of rent units Yi, inside this area i from sample, to i=1,..., 20. Calculate the values: Σ i=1**n Yi=333 and Σi=1**n(yi-yc)**2= 5645,55  // step1: to find the estimation of Y, we got: Y= N/n Σi=1**n yi = 270/20 333=4495,5 So we have 4496 units rent in this townhouse for companies. 
8. coefficient of correlation intraclass: as discuss before, the efficiency of cluster depends how less efficient are their results. So, bigger variability intracluster, more efficience are the sample plan. On the other hand, less variability inside one cluster, less efficience is gonna be the sample plan. So, given this important to the individuals from cluster, is important to use the measure to indicated the similar rate of elements inside cluster. One of this measure more usual is the coefficient for intraclass correlaction (ICC- intraclass correlation coefficient). The ICC offer, so, one measure of homogeneous or Heterogenous inside a cluster. If the measure are equals, we can calculate the ICC as: ICC= Σi=1**N Σj=1**M Σk≠j=1 **M (yij-Y) (Yik-Y)/ (M-1)(NM-1)SY**2 // In pratical, we don't need calculate this formula, because the closer value for one reason among variance inside cluster and the total variance. So, we used this expression to ICC: ICC ≈ 1 - Sd **2/ Sy**2  // where Sd**2 is the variance calculate inside one clust and Sy**2 is the total variance. This total variance is given by add the variance among cluster (Se**2) and the variance inside cluster (Sd**2), so Sy**2= Sd**2+Se**2. More close to 1 the value of ICC, more correlaction it has the unit sample, so, less efficiency is the cluster sample plan. This expression said how the variance inside cluster are big as Sd**1 ≅ Sy**2 so ICC ≅ 1- Sd**2/Sy**2 = 1- Sy**2/Sy**2 ≅ 0. It means, the variance inside the cluster are maximum, the variance among they will be 0 and the ICC are closer 0 too. It's create AC more efficience. If the cluster preasent less intern variability, and the valu of SD**2 is smaller, the ICC is closer in 1 and less efficience to use the cluster sampling in this case. 
Example1: The director from one school had to estimate the average of grades from students who live in townhouse. Besides that  obtain a list of students at townhouse and lead simple random sample, he notice the townhouse had 100 dorms (cluster) with 4 students in eahc one. He choose randomic 5 of this dorms and verified, for each person, the average of curriculum grade. The results are: person 1,2,3,4, total / dorms: 1: 3,08 2,6 3,44 3,04 12,16 2: 2,36 3,04 3,28 2,68 11,36 3: 2 2,56 2,52 1,88 8,96 4: 3 2,88 3,44 3,64 12,96 5: 2,68 1,92 3,28 3,2 11,08 The estimation for population total and the populacional average is, respectively: 1130,40 and 2,82 First step to find the population estimate total we do: Y = N/n Σ i=1**n Yi = 100/5 (12,16+ 11,36 + 8,96+12,96 + 11) We found the average populational estimate we do: YN= Y/M0 How M0 represent the total of unit inside the cluster M0= Σ i=1**N Mi and the enunciation we have 100 cluster and 4 individuals inside, the value of M0 is M0 = 100*4 = 400 So the average estimation is given by: Yn= 1130,40/400 = 2,82 So thie total estimation is equal 1130,40 and the average of grades equal is 2,82 
example2: To find one way to measure the efficience to sample plan for cluster is among the coefficient of correlation intraclass ( or intracluster). So obtain the follow values of variance intracluster Sd**2=687 and the total variance Sy**2=800. This variances, calcule the ICC and said the ICC calculate was 0.14 e how closer with 1 more homogeneous is a conglomerates and less efficience is your used of sampling for cluster. In that sample random by cluster we wait groups of Heterogenous elements inside the clusters to obtain representative of population. One measure for homogeneous is given by coefficient with the correlation intraclass ICC. When calculate the ICC we got ICC ≅ 1- Sd**2/Sy**2 = 1- 687/800 ≅ 0.14 How much more the ICC been close for 1, more homogeneous is a cluster and less efficiency are the sampling of cluster. 
Module 3: describe the sampling of systematic for selection and sample estimation. Before this studies related concept with the estimation from quantity from interested in some search, total and average, for example, in case of sampling cluster. After this, how estimated the variance and the standard error for this estimation. And how it's work the coefficient for correlaction intraclass and it's useful to know the variability for observation and consequences of efficience from cluster plan. So, now study a particular case for cluster and the sistematic sampling. This methodology from sampling selection, besides be simple is using in pratical way. And how to do estimation for sampling draw. 
1. Concept for sistematic sampling SS : The sistematic sampling is a method to sample select used simple and pratical to use. If you have some curiosity and search the word 'sistematic' in dictionary, you can find: orderly, ruled, which behaves accoridng to one method. That's exactly how occurs in this type of sample plan. How the name said sampling systematic SS is depends from a systematixxation from another occurs at the same way. // This method of sampling is different and so using in the pratical with warning. Soposed the elements of one population is on the line. Don't have to select only first, or the last one but just who stay in the middle. The correct is roam all the line and do some selection completely randomic. But how guarantee this list has been roam. Imagine you had been hired to do a search on the line and happen a big show on the other side. Your goal is find some basic informations about this people: where they come from, how long they gonna stay, how much they spend inside the show. You don't have any register, and can't create any stata, how to create cluster for all. And how to do some search like this? Maybe you could think to interview some people on the line time by time. Congrats. You intuitively thought about sistematic sample. You can interview the first on the line, after 10 people inside you interview again. Waint 10 people get inside and interview more 10, and do this successively. The SS consists to selet one unit for each K unit, starts on the beginning of play completely random, the start point have to be drawn. According Kalton (1983) we got consider N elements from population reunited of groups defined for amplitude range N/n and drawn one element for each group to composed the sample. Besides that, the unit are selecting without replacement. That's because doesn't have any sense to interview someone who had been interviewr before that, or just leave the line. After that, the unit had the same chance to be select. Probability for a unit be select: P(s) = 1/K So the probability from a unit do a part of sample depends the value from factor K.
2. Steps to Sample Select:   step 1: Consider population of N unit, ordered by 1 to N. The first step is ordered the list. Step2: Divide the sixxe of population (N) by measure of sample (n), obtain the break of withdrawal (k) and the rest of division c, so: k = N/n to rest 0 and N = n*K+ c to rest ≠ 0 Step3: Select the integer r random among 1 and k, so is 1 ≤ r ≤ k , with probability equals 1/K for all integer on intervals. This number have to be select by SRS. Step4: Finally, select the sample sr using the follow rule: sr = { r+ (j-1) k with j=1, ..., nr er=1,...,k} // Remeber to list all possible samples to take the sr, we're finding the sample space ( set with all possible sample to obtain) from this plan. So, this: nr= { n+1, when r ≤ c } { n, when r > c }  So the rest c be less than the integer r, the sixxe of sample value n, but if the rest be bigger tha sixxe of sample will  be n+1. Because of that, the sixxe of sample aren't fixed. Sumarixxe , found the start point of sampling, has the fixed value, we select next samples. To understand this methodology some examples could helps like:
example 1: at class 20 students want to interview 4 people to ask one search. How could they do this by sistematic sample? Step1: if we have N= 19 we do N= n*K+c = 19=4*4+3 it means K=N/n = 19/4 = 4 with rest 3 Step2: Suposed the select by SRS by r had beened and had found the value 1 and we got c=0, so r>c. In that way, we got nr=n, and n=4, então j could change from 1 to 4 , so we got s1= {r+(j-1)k=1+(1-1)*5=1} . At the first element interview will be the 1 after this next one will be collect from k to k. To the second element, we have 1+k =6 and successively: s1= { 1;1+5;1+10;1+15} = { 1;6;11;16} Step3: if we have r=2 we will have s2 = {2;2+5; 2+10:2+15} = {2;7;12;17} To r=3  we got s3 =  {3;3+5;3+10;3+15} = {3;8;133;18} For r=4 we have s4= {4;4+5;4+10;4+15} = {4;9;14;19} for r=5 we have s5= {5;5+5;5+10;5+15} = {5;10;15;20}  When you find the sequence s1,s2,s3,s4,s5 we have all option from SS to this search. But if we have N=19 substitute 20 individuals.. 
example2: if we have N=19 we will do: N= n*K+c = 19=4*4+3 It means K= N/n = 19/4 = 4 with rest 3 Step1: It's meand k=4 and the rest equal 3. And the sixxe of sample will be variable because for r=1, r=2 and r=3 we got r≤ c, it'll make the sample nr=n+1 that mens nr=5 Step2: we have r=1 s1= {1;1+4;1+8;1+12;1+16} = {1;5;9;13;17}  For r=2 s2 = {2;2+4;2+8;2+12;2+16} = {2;6;10;14;18} For r=3, s3= {3;3+4;3+8;3+12;3+16 } = {3;7;11;15;19} For r=4 the value of r pass be upper than c it have done nr=n So, s4={4;4+4;4+8;4+12} = {4;8;12;16}
Advantages for SS: 1. Ease of execution The AS is a simple and basic metho of sample selection. Because of your simplicity that's a lot of times a comparison by itself AS. And finally is true and easy to select the SRS. And finally is true to select the SRS because at moment the start point, just obtain the sample of regular form (with withdrawal interval k) // 2. Sample Spread: the positive aspect from SS is the method of spread the sample evenly over the population. How the sistematic plan select elements according to interval k of selection, it allow the sample to distribute of regular form above the population. Thats make of none parte of population been privileged at the expense of the others.  
desadvantages of SS:   Besides that is a methos using in pratical, SS presents some of negative aspects:  cost: the first of this is high to search people (scattered sample). How the sample is distributed on population, could have high cost to select the sample, principally if it's too big. 2. Biased estimates: another important point is consider that is a frequency on register to result estimates inefficient, a less the unit of unit are reorder. Imagine one list of companies which is the same selecting by SS given on interval of take and the starts point always be the same. Thats information after a long period could presents estimates trends, so have to reorder the register to avoid this type of problem. 3. Complication to estimation precision: to find the real problem SS occurs in estimation of measure precision. That's a real complicated to estimated the variance of this type of sampling. According to Bolfarine (2005) in this case of population is random order, doesn't exist the variance of estimator obtain from the sistematic sample by estimative of estimator from SRS. This a important factor because just with all computacional resource could be difficult to find the variance. So, it's done the pratical to be closer this estimation for formula of variance by SRS. 
Estimation by SS: The estimation of sistematic sample plan are done by simple expressions. The problem urges when it pretend fo som variance estimation. To cases of sample presents don't presents any type of trend, we use some expressions of variance cloase in SRS. So, we gotten:  1. Average estimation: Yas= Yˆas/N = k Σi=1**n Yi/N = 1/n Σi=1**n Yi  // 2. Total estimation: Yas= k Σi=1**n Yi = Kyr //3. Estimation of populacional proportion (sample proportion): pˆAS = 1/n Σi=1**n Yi = yAS ///4. Estimation of variance by average estimation: Vˆ(y AS) = N- n Σi=1**n (yi-yAs)**2/ Nn (n-1) = (N-n/n) s**2/n  ///5. Estimation of variance from total estimation: V(yˆ AS) = N**2(1/n - 1/N) S**2 Remenber s**2 = Σi=1**n (yi - y AS) **2/n-1   // 6. Estimation of variance for proportion estimator: Vˆ(p^AS) = (N-n/N) pˆ(1-pˆ)/n-1   Besides that the standard error are estimated given by: Ep= √ V^  Now you understand the expression using to do the estimation with SS let's do the pratical exercise. In interactive museum pretends investigate the test for public about your collection. Because of thta at final of route the art in exposition pretend interview some individuals. How doesn't desire to create any type of data trendy, but share the search, it were think abou a sistematic sampling. In general 210 people pass the museun and to don't tired people, they do a sampling with 20 people. First of all, calculate the interval of taken obtain k= N/n = 210/20 = 10 with rest c=10. With k=10 to select our inside r among 1 and 10.e SRS let's supposed has taken r=5. It means first person had been intervierw is the 5 after that 10 by 10. How r ≤ c, we got nr= n+1. In this way, let's interview 21 people. The reply obtain: Person: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 29 20 21 //Add//  position on the line: 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 135, 145, 155, 165, 175, 185, 195, 205 - /// Like the museum: 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 16  // time limit inside the museum (minimun): 30 60 40 20 40 60 40 50 20 30 45 25 60 30 20 90 80 100 90 40 50 1020  // money spent with souvennir 20 0 40 10 5 30 0 20 30 0 0 0 50 10 20 20 50 80 70 20 50 525  Let's do some estimation for the average time inside the museum, the total pent with souvenni in story and if the person like the museum (1- like and 0 don't like). Besides that, we find the estimation of variance and your standard error: Estimation on average time inside the museum: y AS= 1/21 Σ i=1 **21 yi= 1020/21 = 48,4 minutes  // Remember the time had to be the same measure unit, or all in minutes or hours. so, this average estimation of time for people inside of museum is 48,5 minutes. The total estimation is given by: yˆ AS = k Σ i=1**n yi=kyr= 10*525= 5250 BRL At this way the estimation of sale in store of museum is almost 5250 BRL/day. 
The estimation of proportion of people were like the museum is p^AS= 1/21 Σi=1**21 yi= 16/21 ≅ 0,76. So we have almost 76% of people who evaluated positive the collection museum. The estimation of average variance is given by: Vˆ(y AS) = (N-n/N) s**2/n. So we need to find s**2. Means, s**2= Σi=1**n(yi-y AS)**2/n-1= (30-48,5)**2+...(50-48,5)**2/20= 11807/20 ≅ 590,35 Means Vˆ(y AS) = (N-n/N)s**2/n = (210-21/210) 590,35/21 ≅ 25,3 It means, the standard error is given by Ep= √V^(y AS)= √25,3 ≅ 5,02 In this way the standard error deccurs of estimation in average time of permanecy inside the museun  almost 5 minutes. This value logically changes from person by person, but in average this error of measure is 5 minutes. To total variance estimation we gotte: Vˆ(yˆAS) = N**2 (1/n - 1/N) s**2 = 210**2*(1/21-1/210) 590,35 = 1115761 It means, the standard erro is given by Ep= √Vˆ(y^AS) = √1115761 = 340,23 In this time we said the standard error is estimation of total spent by customers on store  to thie sample is almost 340 BRL. Finally we found the estimation on variance of proportional populational. We do Vˆ(p^AS) = (N-n/N) pˆ(1-pˆ)/n-1 = (210-21/210) 0,76(1-0,76)/21-1 ≅  0,008 So, the standard error is given by Ep = √V^(p^AS) ≅ 0,09 It said, the error by estimation of people who said liked to see the exposition is almost 9%. 
3. Relation with sampling by cluster: Now after to understand all the sampling sistematic, how to asnwert this questions: How to related between AC and AS? Maybe you had found the answer, but, check this table? 1 2 3 4 5  | 6 7 8 9 10 | 11 12 13 14 15 | 16 17 18 19 20 | 21 22 23 24 25 | 26 27 28 29 30 | 31 32 33 34 35 | 36 37 38 39 40 | 41 42 43 44 45 | 46 47 48 49 50   (select: 4 9 14 19 24 29 34 39 44 49) To example: suposed the population N= 50 people and they want to do a search with 10 individuals. In this case, our k equal 5. If you repair o the last tabl, we did the sistematic sampling, each 5 person, from 4 element selecting by SRS . But look how interessed, you can think for each one of this group of 5 people is a cluster, it means, eachs 5 could be consider a cluster. In this way, we can consider the SS to partciular case from SC when the cluster had fixed measure. According to Bolfarine (2005) the selection of sistematic sample is gonna be select by a sample of cluster, in this number of cluster A= K and this k cluster is a element select to be observed. 
sistematic sample:  Example1 The owner of restaurant pretends select 50 customers loyal to tasting a new recipe to include on the menu. He got a register on new loyal costumer numbered sequentially from 1 to 1980. Toe the select, he decide using the technique of sistematic sampling. In this situation, in case of selection range equal 39 and the first populational unit select been the 12a, the third population unit to be select will be the 90a // we got N= 1980 and n=50 So we can find the interval of take K, doing k= 1980/50 = 39 and the rest c= 30 The point to start this sampling will given and the value is 12. In this way, the first individual to be interview is the 12o after this 12+39 = 51. Finally, the third populational unit to be select is gonna be 51+k = 51+39 = 90
example2: the population is composed with 2960 elements had been ordered in line. The seard pretends make a survey of data to take a sistematic sample of 20 elements from this population. Which will be the position of the three first elements and the last three elements selects? Besides that consider the first element to be select on the position 44. To find the sample, we need to find initially the interval of k select, so k= 1980/20 = 148 and the rest c=0. The point to start 44 in the line, we gotten the three firts samples composed by 44, 44+k and 44+2*k. So, we have 44, 192 and 340. How our sample with sixxe 20, we got find three last elements on this way: 44= K*16 , 44+k*17 , 44+k*18 = 2412, 2560, 2856. multiple 16, 17, ad 18 substitue 18, 19, and 20 because the first value from k (k=1) is used just on the second element. 
Sumarixxe this part we studying about the cluster sampling, with one, two or multiple stages besides the sistematic sampling. We saw the comparison between some sample plan and the importance of coefficient to correlaction intracluster. initially understand the concept of fundamentals samples for cluster, create cluster and the importance of heterogeneity inside groups. After thats the difference of cluster of one, two or multiple stages. The second parte studying statistics tools of estimation by interessed quantities. How to estimate total and the average by a cluster sample, and variance estimation of this measure. Using this measure to work the efficience question by SC, in case, the coefficient of correlation intraclass (ICC). More closeru 0 the ICC has, less correlation are their sample units, and the plan is more efficience. Finally, searching some sistematic sample, a particular case of sampling cluster. We studying methodology of this aspects and select some sample for this methods. In the end using expressions from SS to do estimation from variables of interessed to do this search. Then, understand the importance of sampling for cluster and the sistematic, how to do this estimation for variables of interessed to any sample plan.
