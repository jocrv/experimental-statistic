PART 3
Using the sample stratified for specif quantity. Allocation the sample in some strata, estimator proportion and the sixx of sample necesary to that calculus. Propose: Presents this technique for estimator quantity for interest searching and do it with allocation in some of strata. Preparation: before begin this theme, use the normal distribution for table . Goals: 1. describe the method for select sample random strata and the importance to use strata and the reason for stratification. 2. define the notation for use the stratification with expression to total estimator, average and stratification variance. 3. define variables for proportion e the sixxe for sample using on this sample stratification simple with differents allocation availables.
average and total, describe the method to select samples randomic stratification, used strata and the reason for stratification. 
3.1 concepts about stratification sample: For example, you need do some sample around the country, but it need to be randon and you have to chosse 1000 people. But in this case you can choose some specific regions more than other, and another one could not apper in this search. You can solve this problem with stratification. You got 3 points: 1. you can get the specific habit in some places. 2. if you have information divide the population in part or subset ou strata to use for researching and reduce the error of sample, otherwise reduce the sixxe of sample. 3. that helps the error sample because none of group will be empty. So it's possible use some variability in this strata which helps to samples in all strata. ||| Classifications, regionalixxation, administration division in every region urban or rural. This case the subset gonne treats as strata.
Basic concepts:  stratification(the process to divide the population on subset, the way which elements of population belonging for one subset, named stratification) strata(the process which subset of population will divide and defines your strata) natural strata (when some elements of population are subdivide on subset defines by geographic criterial, political lines, class, categories, named natural strata. The Classification of this industry, the line betweenil or another federation unit, the separate of population, as a occasion on that place on urban or rural population are examples of strata). Statistics strata ( are defined by Statistic or searching of this area to define some strata as subset more homogeneous of population. The idea is increase the estimation efficienc. When this elements of population are reunit on subset are defined on function of dimension from one variable X, as a possibilitie to increase with precision  this sample, or reduce this sixxe on subset constitute stratas of sixxe, for example. That classification of industry as some industry tracks or classification of establishments agricultural on function of this area for example of strata of sixxe.) 
3.2 Example for searching using this stratification:
