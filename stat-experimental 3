Using the sample stratified for specif quantity. Allocation the sample in some strata, estimator proportion and the sixx of sample necesary to that calculus. Propose: Presents this technique for estimator quantity for interest searching and do it with allocation in some of strata. Preparation: before begin this theme, use the normal distribution for table . Goals: 1. describe the method for select sample random strata and the importance to use strata and the reason for stratification. 2. define the notation for use the stratification with expression to total estimator, average and stratification variance. 3. define variables for proportion e the sixxe for sample using on this sample stratification simple with differents allocation availables.
average and total, describe the method to select samples randomic stratification, used strata and the reason for stratification. 
3.1 concepts about stratification sample: For example, you need do some sample around the country, but it need to be randon and you have to chosse 1000 people. But in this case you can choose some specific regions more than other, and another one could not apper in this search. You can solve this problem with stratification. You got 3 points: 1. you can get the specific habit in some places. 2. if you have information divide the population in part or subset ou strata to use for researching and reduce the error of sample, otherwise reduce the sixxe of sample. 3. that helps the error sample because none of group will be empty. So it's possible use some variability in this strata which helps to samples in all strata. ||| Classifications, regionalixxation, administration division in every region urban or rural. This case the subset gonne treats as strata.
Basic concepts:  stratification(the process to divide the population on subset, the way which elements of population belonging for one subset, named stratification) strata(the process which subset of population will divide and defines your strata) natural strata (when some elements of population are subdivide on subset defines by geographic criterial, political lines, class, categories, named natural strata. The Classification of this industry, the line betweenil or another federation unit, the separate of population, as a occasion on that place on urban or rural population are examples of strata). Statistics strata ( are defined by Statistic or searching of this area to define some strata as subset more homogeneous of population. The idea is increase the estimation efficienc. When this elements of population are reunit on subset are defined on function of dimension from one variable X, as a possibilitie to increase with precision  this sample, or reduce this sixxe on subset constitute stratas of sixxe, for example. That classification of industry as some industry tracks or classification of establishments agricultural on function of this area for example of strata of sixxe.) 
3.2 Example for searching using this stratification: On pratical way we dont used the stratification, but we have natural strata and the sixxe at the same time. It's commom to used this definition on set to increase more the quality of search. Example Brasilian Intitute of Geography and Statistic, are using two types of strata: the natural and final.
3.2.1 Natural is the combination the economyc activities of companies, and construct for a specific Statistic stata.  
3.2. 2  Advantages of stratas samples: the best precision of estimated: thats stratification could be more precise. If you compare the stratification samples (SS) with simple random sample (SRS) isnot necesary less error. Using simple strata don't produce a efficient more than (SRS). But if you do the the right strata you could descrease variance of estimator. That result is possible for less sample, and less budge, and don't forget the less variability.
3.2. 3 Ensure the note of samples in created stratas: defined data from stratas you need select the samples for each one independent, so any strata could be empty. That selection is done independent and the strata are mutual exclusionary, thats means one person couldn't stay at mutual groups or strata at the same time. 
3.2. 4  Allows estimator for each population group from search: one of Advantages for stratification search is the estimates for each strata are for created by search groups. || We can estimated for each strata how it's necesary for differents  strata. As independent of strata, you can estimate for independent form too. You can do the estimator of the total from one strata and the average for another, for example. 
3.2.5 that could be operationally convenience: for every search were doing by SRS when the sample are randomixxed  for that populatio. stratification could limits our interest, which will simplify collect. First of all, to spend descrease, not only only place of unit, but a lot of individual by strata.
3.3 Disadvantages of simple random: not everything are flowers, not only positive points on the sample stratified from sample error. Need this: knowledge for variables from stratified for all unit in register befores sample. ( all companies need a unit for federation, economyc activities and quantity for employees. First of all using this variable of unit from this federation and economic select this enterprise which will be a part of sample and after that quantity the number of employees to distribute all strata sample). 2. Divide the population at many stratified could exists tiny samples at any strata. 
To define all stratas you have tho check the register, if it has all individuals enough to select, it couldn't estimate the variance, and the estimation of total need to be limits. We got in this 1 strata 4 enterprise, but just one answer. Notice the quantity of information avaiables on this strata. We can't calculte the variance, because it exists just one enterprise, thats happens because we concetrate our result in just one enterprise. What you do? Run to enterprises which doesn't replied to reverse the non-collect thats information, or define better how this strata to be bigger than 4 enterprise.
3.4  reason for stratified: 
3.4.1 the desire to increase the precision for estimated given by a variability from interest characteristic could be big. Thats better from precision from estimate be reduce by variance from estimators after construct strata. 2. ensure this disclosure from information to each domain from interest or estiamte the estimates for segments by population. Fix each strata, or be better control for errors. 3. that strata form natural groupt for interest. People who lives in region could had life habit  for differents regions. So this strata has studies object. 4. replicate the sample of same composition from population based on specif characteristic. If we knoe the composed by population was based on 52% of women, and 48% men, beside thats 10% have superior graduated, 50% high school and 40% basic school we can created this samples exaclty the same distribution. The sample will created with proportion variable by population.
3.4.2 spread the sample of population. As all strata have the select sample, this process of stratification automatically spread the sample for each one of thie sample groups.
4. efficiency criterion: to gain efficiency with the stratification, the idea will change values from variable from studies from each strata to similar or homogeneous as possible, it means minixxe the variance inside the stratas. The stratification idea  is create stratas for been similar. Which means the variance inside of stratas will be smaller variance among the upper stratas. For this happens it's fundamental been acess to register with variable to use stratification the population as efficiency way. In this way minixxe the variability intrastrata and maximixxe the variance of strata. 
5. General method: partition the population U on H subset mutual exclusive e exaustive named strata. Two event named mutual exclusive, when they doens't occur at the same time. When you play one coin, that event could be heads or tails but never both at the same time. This exaustive term said the fact that category is only one unit sample. So, this samples have to stay in just one strata, or all the strata and have shows in all samples. In math notation we got the represent of strata named Uh, so: U1,...Uh,.... UH, this way U= U1 ∪ U2 ∪... ∪ Uh = ∪  H h=1 Uh and Uh ∩ Uk =  Ø, h≠ k. That means Nh, the sixxe Uh so N1+ N2+... + Nh= N || After that that population stratas we can select samples sh from sixxe Nh with Nh> 0 , according the natural select independent inside every strata h , when h=1,2,...H and ΣH h=1 nh= n So this way are secure to strata have your population represents on the final sample, because s=s1 ∪ s2 ∪  sh 
6. Simple stratified sample: SS is a method to element of population are divided by groups named strata. So, let's suposed a group have to do a search in industry at some region, we got two type red and blue. Red are almost of them. after this the stratas 1 and 2 we could select the sample to represent exactly that population proportion. if we got 2/3 red, 1/3 blue we can select one of each stratas at the same proportion. So, if our sample were sixxe 9, we have 6 red and 3 blue. But how we select this companies inside of the stratas. In this case we have the simple random sample. Step by step: 1. the simple random sample (SRS) we do this random select for each element for equal probability for drawn for sample, it's select independent each other. 2. it means that random procedure, drawn equals probability for population elements. This way, the simple random sample is gonna take for each strata for represent, by the way it could possibility better estimate for population.   
examples: exists a lot of methods to select sample of data. The sample plan named sample stratified means: divide population on subset of units, and select the sample inside on of subset, but each select independent from each other. That definition of stratified of sample is divide some population on subset named strata, as name, gender, salary, region. After that select samples for each sample on this subset. So, that select in each strata have to be independent from each other. 
example2: For this stratified sample the population are divided by stratas from selection and each strata are construct for a possible variability estimated. This measure are variable to obtain among strata and inside of strata. For this variability we can affirm: In this stratified sampling, the variance inside this stratas have to be smaller, and the variance have to stay among stratas have to be bigger. || On this theory the stratified sampling, the population have to divide each strata, so inside the strata the populationhave to be homogeneous. This idea is created eahc groups in the population unit similar, that means, share habits, opinions, similar mores. So, the variability inside stratas is smaller, the variance among stratas have to be bigger. Than, if the variability intrastrata have to be smaller, while the variability among regions is bigger.
PART 3.2
Define the notation using to stratified, with expression in total estimation, average and variance for stratification sampling.
On this module, let's do estimation of variables for sample allocation using stratified. First, undertsand the concept of sample weight the notation and basic definition, after that use math expressions to do estimate for sampling theory. Then, distribute the select sampl for strata to specif sample allocation. 
1. sample weight: this concept is the base for sample plan, which is the idea for sample weight. The weight represent the population unit. When do some sample, adjust part of poulation which will analyse, and the sample result gonna be compatible and need to adjust the result for population. The sample weight represents the number of unit from population. Sample weight represent the number of units from population which will be represents for that specif unit from sample. 
Example1:  do some search about studies(yi) of certain population with 120 persons. Learn about differents stratification you can decide create stratas to separate differents levels of instruction. Using the index h for denote the quantity of strata, for example, we have 3 strata, means h=3. step by step means: 1. strata 1- fundamental leve strata2- medium level strata3- superior level. When consult you find 70 persons of fundamental level, 30 medium level, 20 superior level. But you just can't interview all 120, and you do a sample to choose only 20 people. step2: after do the table with the average for sixxe strata.Using the quantity to population as calculator factor in general average, which means N1= 70, N2= 30 e N3=20. This factors using: y= Σ h i=1 Ni Yi/ N = N1Y1/N + N2Y2/N + N3Y3/N = N1/N Y1 + N2/N Y2 + N3/N Y3 --- 70/120 0,78 + 30/120 1,41 + 20/120 4,75 = 192,1/120 = 1,6 hours
In general average thats done consider stratification. That the right value for general average, and no ignore all stratas. What we do it's consider the average calculte, the sixxe of population strata. Meanwhile, exists more people from fundamental level, so we need to weight the reply. That factor we used Nh/N so exactly knowing how is weight sample, which is weighted the fraction of exists elements in the population related with the result N. That sample function gonna used to pratice the name Wh, so all time we need to consider the sixxe of some strata on related with the total relation we do the divided from the total by general total, named the result Wh.
2. Basic Notation and Estimation : sampling stratified using a lot of variables on the construct to expressions using on process for estimated. For population, named variable from interest by parameters. Our goal, is estimate this populacional parameter through the sample. To identifiy this unit, using the notation: one identifier h(h=1,...H) to indicate the strata which are attachment. One identifier i (i=1,...Nh) to indicate the unit inside the strata. One value from variable for search named Yhi for i=1, Nh, e h=1,...H. The population sixxe done by N1+N2+...Nh=N1. The sample sixxe are done by n1+n2+...nh=n 
3. Population parameter: total Y= Σ H h=1 Yh = Σ H h=1 NhYh  Media Y = Y/N = ΣH h=1 Nh Yh/N = Σ H h=1 Wh Yh which Wh= Nh/N  Variance: s2= ΣHh=1[(Nh-1)s 2h=Nh(Yh-Y)2]/(N-1)
4. Estimator population parameters: thats expressions are refeer to population values but in pratical way we need to work with samples. As sampling is done about strata, we can estimated the parameter for each strata. Though the estimate of stratification sampling with unit select of samples for simple sample with replacement is: 1. total estimator yest= Σ H h=1 Yh = Nh Σ nh h=1 Yh/ nh = Σ H n=1 Nh Yh  2. medium estimator: Y est= Wh Σ nh h=1 Yh/nh = Σ H h=1 WhYh  3. variance estimator:  S2h = Σ nh i=1 [( Yhi - Yh)2]/ (Nh-1)  4. Estimator of variance of total estimator: v(Yest) = Σ H h=1 N 2s2h/hnh   5. error pattern of estimator total variance: Ep(Y est)= √v(Yest) = √ΣH h=1 N2s2h/hnh  6. Estimator of variance of medium estimator v(Y est) =  Σ H h=1 W2s2h/hnh   7. Pattern error of estimator from medium variance : Ep(Y est) = √ v(Yest) = √ΣH h=1 w2sh2/hnh   \\\ one technology company has some interest to know users on small city with internet. For this it hired one team to do this search, for estimate the middle number of hours how that users can stay online. In the end 80 people was interviewed based on the simple stratification sample. The region is divides on 4 each areas: area A, area B, area C, and area D.  From area A, B and C consider urban, besides that D area is rural. Exists 620 residents in city, divide as: 310 area A, 155 area B, 93 area C and 62 area D. The sixxe of sample are select by differents among stratas. The table resume the weight of each strata, the sixxe, the average, the variance. step by step: step1 (finde the average populational estimate of numbers of hours to residents acess internet.) Y est= ΣH h=1 WhYh= [ 0,5 • 30+ 0,25 • 25 + 0,15 • 23 + 0,1 • 19 ]= 26,6 hours // step2: find the estimate of average sample, so we can find your estimate of variance:  v(Y est)= Σ H h=1 w2h s2h/ Nh = print( pow (0.5, 2) * print(pow(5,5))/ 40 + print(0,25**2 * 16**2)/20 + print(0,15**2)  * 13**2)/ 12 + (0,1**2  * 9,5**2)/8 = 0,15625+ 0,8 + 0,316875 + 0,1128125 = 1,39 
Find the standard error: Ep(Yest) = √v(Yest)= 1,18 // that means the standard error of estimation is less than 1 hour for using internet.
5. allocation the sample: after saw all the proceed about estimation, according all samples we defined for strata. Now, we need to understand how the distribution n units of samples by strata. This process named sample allocation and it's importanto because it's guarantee to precision the sampling procedure. We have 3 principal form for distribute that sample among strata. This allocation is done, in general, according the preview knowledge involves: 1. uniform allocation: in uniform stratified sampling we have the same sixxe of sample for each strata. That allocation is more simple and basic, though more intuitive, it's not the better choose for efficiency. Imagine the population divide in three color, but one of them the division is not equal. On this time AE with uniform allocation, the sample distribute equal way. So, for each strata h: Nh= N/k (k represents the number of strata / the global sixxe from sample is divide by k number of strata. So if you have one sixxe of sample from 90 and 3 levels od stratas, tha sample of each strata is gonna be: Nh=90/3= 30 individuals). Just divide the total number of sample to quantity of strata. 
6. Proportion Allocation: another way to do this distribution is by credit which maintain fraction of sampling by each strata h equals population fraction. Means this type of allocation, the sample preview was define dixxe n and distribute proportional each sixxe of strata.   nh= n Nh/N   /// Imagine one search, you have on population 800 families in urban area, and 300 families rural area ( total populacional -> N= 800 + 300= 1100 families). If total sample to select is 90 families, we do: nh = n Nh/N ->  n1= 90 800/1100 -> n1= 65,45 = 66 families of strata 1 //  nh = n Nh/N -> n2= 90 300/1100 -> n1 = 24.54 = 25 families // In this way the proportional alocation is rounded to upper values, so n=91 families with 66 from strata 1(urban) and 25 strata 2(rural). Basically, we reply the population structure in sample.
7. Optimal Neyman Allocation: this method is about alocation samples in strata. As the name said, is great. In this case, the distribution of sample aren't thinking on exists proportion on population, but in your variability. In this alocation Neyman, the variability from variable are interested to consider, because if it's more homogeneous on population, we don't need sample big in this strata. That means, the distribution will consider the dispersion of variable of population. The sixxe nh are proportional on Nh from population, and standard deviations sh from characteristic Y in each strata h. That expression is: nh = n Nhsh/ Σ H h=1 Nh sh  // Where n represents the sixxe of sample sh represents standard deviations of variable y in strata h and Nh represents the sixxe of strata h. Notice in this case how the distribution of sample doesn't follow the population pattern. It's happen because the variability of individual red were bigger than blue. So we need a sample red bigger than blue. In this way, the structure of sample will consider not only the sixxe of populational but the variability. Theory on pratic: population sixxe 20 is divided on 2 stratas, 8 on strata 1, 12 on strata 2. The standard deviation 1 is s1= 0,64 and s2= 1,34. If the sample of sixxe is sixxe 10 is select, how are te distribution for each strata? nh = n Nh sh/ Σ H h=1 Nh sh => n1 = 10 8 • 0,64/ (8• 0,64 + 12 • 1,34) = 2,4 individual on strata 1  /// nh = n Nhsh/ Σ H h=1 Nhsh => n2 = 10 12 • 1,34/ (8•0,64+12 • 1,34) = 7,6 individuals on strata 2   /// if add n1 e n2 got 10, but we need to decide if we rounded both for upper or no. If its done for upper, we got n1=3 e n2= 8. The sample pass be 11, this value is more concret, but if we cannot do the sample 11, recommends rounder for upper the strata by lower sixxe because what's lower, it's better be upper. We got n1=3 e n2=7.
example 1:  On search using simple random sample for analyse the stratification of some producers were effective for coffee plants provided ny Agro business 2006. Sposed the total of establishment are present like the above table, and variance of each strata. Suposed the cost of sample is equal in all strata and the sixxe of sample is total 1000, determine the sixxe of sample for each strata, based on th neyman's optimal allocation: strata - total 1, 2,3 | effective of coffee planta 262-301, 302-3335, 336-24355 | total of establishment (8680) 80, 600, 8000 | variance s1**2 = 900 s2**2 = 1600 s3**2=2500 |  sample n1 n2 n3  |/// sample values n1, n2, n3 6,56,938 //  using the neyman's optimal allocation we got N_h and variance s_hˆ2 for each investiment. By formula Neyman, we got: nh=n Nhsh/Σh=1**H Nhsh // we need find the standard deviation, when root of the variance dph= √(sh**2) = sh / n1= 1000 80√900/80√900 + 600√1600+8000√2500 = 6 //n2= 1000 600√1600/80√900+600√1600+8000√2500= 56 / n3= 1000 8000√2500/80√900+600√1600+8000√2500 = 938
example 2: a search doing in shopping mall are determine the total of the money spend on cinema based on socioeconomic condition. the idea thought on differents programs for futures discounts. It's created 3 strata based on future income. Strata 1 high class, strata 2 medium class and strata 3 low class. Knowing N1=300, N2=700 and N3=1000. The sample of 200 individual are interviewed. The table below resume the value: strata 1,2,3 | class high, medium, low | Yh: 180, 85,30 | variance s1**2 =100 s2**2=144 s3**2= 225 | sample nh 30, 70, 100 | the estimate of the total spent from population with cinema at this month, and the estimate for standard error:  Yest = 143500 reais and Ep(Yest) = 1414 reais  // first using the expression for estimate related for population total, using the estimation: Yest= Σh=1**H yh=Σh=1**H NhYh=300**180 + 700*85 + 1000*30 = 143500 / related with the variance for total estimador v(Yest) =Σh=1**H Nh**2 sh**2/nh = 300**2 * 100/30 + 700**2 *144/70 + 1000**2 * 225/100 = 3558000 // to find the standard error: Ep(Yest)= √v(Yest) = √3558000=1886 // in that way the estimate of total spent with cinema this month at city is r$ 143.500,00 and the associated standard error from this measure is r$ 1.886 
PART 3.3   
In this module, we will estimate quantity of interested to search, total and average, as example with simple stratification sample. We studied how to estimated the standard error with this estimate. After that understando how to allocation the sample in each strata by consider the choose uniform, proportional or Neyman. Now, dimension of this sixxe of sample to sample plan of stratification sampling. Besides that , how the estimation of variable proportion which are interested to study occur some characteristicof population.
1. Proportion estimation in stratification sampling: More than quantity variables, a search could be contain qualitative variables. This tratament relatives for estimation of data and calculus sample sixxe are doing to another way. Sometimes this estimates the proportion or percentage for units of population to certain characteristic or attribute, or integrate for certain category. As much results of census and survey assume this way, as, for example a proportion of people who take a loan at bank, a percentage of population constitute foreigns. // Basically, the variable of proportion is a reason of number of population units from this population. the denominator is always a number of population unit, and the result could be a proportion between 0 or 1, being represent a percentage. The qualitatives variable we couldn't do any kind of calculus, so thats restricted just for quantity variables. So what we do in this case is count how many individuals has this characteristic in population. This way we created a variable y, for exemple, what receive a value Yi=1 for each unit with the same characteristic and Yi=0 on the other hand.  // Yi = 1 if i has a characteristic; 0 if the i has not a characteristic. On the stratification sample, we have the add of y_i in each construct strata. If we want estimated some proportion of unit on population in the square defined C class, the ideal stratification have to be on the first strata with all or almost of them individual with characteristic, in the other strata, the individuals without the same characteristic( or presented less). Example: we need to do this search to estimate the proportion of a lot characteristic the people who attend shopping mall.  The ideal scenario is strata 1 had only people who frequently go to the shopping and the strata 2 all them. How we can stimate the independentway of one strata, will be interested. For all pratic effect you can take best result in case you do this. because is possible estimate how each strata (one with a characteristic and another without) after that make comparison. So, tell us the step of construct the strata is the fundamental point of search, to affect the efficience of this strata. With the values Yi, of sample for each strata h we can estimate the populacional proportion, the variance of proportion and the standard error among simple stratification sample without replacement, for this way:
- populacional proportion: Ph =  Σi=1**N Yhi/ Nh 
- proportion sample of one strata: ph= Σ i=1**n Yhi/nh 
- variance of Y on the strata H is given by: Sh**2 = Nh Ph(1-Ph)/Nh-1 
The proportion estimate for all population, means, for all stratas simultanaly on sample random given by: pestr= Σi=1**N NhPh/N = Σi=1**N WhPh
- populacional varince from proportion estimated: V ae(Pestr) = Σh=1**H wh**2(Nh-nh/Nh-1) Ph(1-Ph/nh)
- variance estimated from proportion estimate: Vae(Pestr) = Σh=1**H wh**2(Nh-nh/Nh-1)ph(1-ph/nh)
- standard error from proportion estimate: Ep ae(Pestr) = √Vae(pestr) = √Σh=1**H w2(Nh-nh/Nh-1) ph(1-ph)/nh 
For this expressions, you can look proportion how this weighted average consider the weight for each strata on population, besides that add variables values, add yi=1 for each strata and individual divide for total. Ex1: means simple stratification sample for 400 children with less than 6 months of certain hospital. Data this maternity suggest the construct of two strata, according to using or not after birth. In strata 1, babies has the neonatal assistance with the total of N1=657 children. On strata 2 has babies who doesn't need hospitalixxation, and total is N2= 1353  children.  
2. The sixxe of sample: The planning of search, the calculus of sixxe sample is a very important stage. One industrial drawn with a quantity of replys big enough could implies a waste of resources , when one little sample could decrease the quality of results. This decisions not only could be done surely and it's based on budget available and the quality you want. The basic method for select the simple random sample (SRS). In this sample plan all sample units have the sample probability to be select. On this stratification sample, this value changed acordding to the strata of the unit origin. If we take the same quantity of sample for each strata (SRS) is natural the strata be bigger for unit to select the probability less to be select and the smaller strata have unit with bigger probability because the population is lower. This sample weight is an important variable and need to take consider the moment toe all calculus for each sample sixxe.  
3. The theory on pratic:  imagine for example, you desire take a sample for 5 individuals and 3 stratas which refeer for social class. In the 1 strata has N1=1200 individual, in the strata 2 N1=5000 individual, in the strata 3 N3=300 individual. The probability the select to the strata 1 is P1=5/1200 = 0,004; P2= 5/5000 = 0,001 e P3= 5/300 = 0,02. Notice the lower strata presents more probabilities for select. Besides that, in pratical, we find the sixxe of stratification sample, check this: step 1: identifiy the variable which we want investigate . Is it a average? Total? Proportion? Step 2: after identify the variable of this study, using the especific expressions for each variable to find the sixxe for sample. Step 3: Finally, the total sixxe for sample we used the allocation for each distributefor strata sample. At final we add the sample for each strata to be equal the sixxe for sample. Let's see the calculus to sixxe the sample based on the average fot total and proportion for differents allocation. 
4. Sixxe of sample for estimate the average for stratification  sampling: if you have this intereste to ask questions conncet with the average for determined variables, we need to use this conjuct this especific express for sample sixxe. This expressions changes based one the allocation of sample which thought at momento to construct this search.   The general expression for sixxe is the sample of  stratification sampling for estimation average is given by: n = Σh=1**H Wh**2 sh**2/ αh/ V+1/N  Σh=1**H Whsh**2 when Wh= Nh/N and αh is a constant to define the type of allocation whic are used. On the other hand we used just this formula because we don't have allocation for sample, so we find the specific expression for each case. So, this formula changes based on the choose allocation. Let's check this two sample distribution more using, the case are proportional and Neyman optimal allocation formula.
5. proportional allocation: n = n0/ 1+n0/N  with n0= Σh=1**H Wh sh**2/V where the minimun variance is desire to estimate the population average. This variance is on fuction of margin error "d" and value of normal table. In case this aren't given, you can calculated with: V= (d/ ζ α/2 ) **2  It means, in this case, first of all, calculate n0 and after calculated n. We can do this substitue and have just one formula, but based on Cochran(1977) do this separate with gains with computacional terms. Pratical example to understand the sixxe sample to calculate in this case. Example1:  A company of iron ore of one type of iron in a new slab they are producing. The iron using is divide for 3 types for a component be more resistent and less oxidantive (type I, type II and type III). The search before have been evaluated the variance for this types of iron on each slab and the variance found was s1**2= 1,4% for type I, s2**2=1,2% for type II and s3**2= 1,1% for type III. Another type of data provided to iron produced for each type: 13800T for the type I, 23400T for type II and 22800T for type III. The minimun variance V set were 0,02. What is the sixxe for minimun sample necesary, to have to know the proportional allocation in each strata? step by step: step 1: to reply this question, we need to find the weight for each strata, that means the value of wh. So, we got: wh= Nh/N = w1=13800/60000=0,23 w2= 23400/60000 =0,39 and w3=22800/60000=0,38 Step 2: with the weight found we need find n0 that means: n0=  Σh=1**H whsh**2/V = 0,23 . 1,4**2 + 0,39.1,2**2+0,38.1,1*2/0,02 = 73,61 Step3: n= n0/1+n0/N = n= 73,61/1+73,61/60000=73,51 rounded for upper, we got the sixxe of sample for 74 slabs iron for this search.  
6. Neyman's Optimal Allocation: the another way to do the sample distribution for strata we see were the Neyman optimal allocation. How this consider the variability for each strata, thats the preference, if possible, pratical using stratification sampling. So, for AE with neyman Optimal allocation for average stratification we got this sample sixxe: n = ( Σh=1**H Whsh)**2/ V+Σh=1**H Whsh**2/N  
7.  Sixxe of sample for estimation of total sampling stratification: at the same way we do the average estimation we can do calculus for each sixxe sample for our interested variable estiamted population total. This result are so similar. Again, as expressions changes by allocation of sample at moment to construct the search. In general: n= Σ h=1**H Nh**2 sh**2/αh/V+Σh=1**H Nhsh**2 where Wh= Nh/N and αh  is a constant to define the type of allocation using. But, not used just for a formula, because have to do the allocation of sample, so we can find especific expression for each case. And, the formulas changes according to allocation choose. Let's see again two sample distribution more sing, because in this proportional case, and neyman optimal and the variance V is given by: V= (d/ ζ α/2)**2   
8. proportional allocation: in case of stratification sampling with proportional allocation, the weight of strata and sample percentage in each strata has the same value. If have 30% of strata A in population, we got 30% of sample like A. So, wh=Nh/N substituethis value on general expression we got the follow result for samle sixxe for the population result: n= n0/1+n0/N with n0= N/V Σh=1**H Nhsh**2 
9. neyman Optimal Allocation: at the same way we do the neyman allocation for average, we can do for this total to. In this case, the sample weight in function for variability for each strata. So we got the expression for calculus in sixxe of sample for neyman optimal allocation: n= (Σh=1**H Nhsh)**2/ V+ Σh=1**N Nhsn**2
10. Sixxe for sample of estimate proportion: if you have the interest to search and reply the qualitative questions, have to think in sample calculus using the proportion. This formulas are similar for cases before, we need to substitue the variable of average or total of proportion variables. This expression have to change by allocation sample thought at momento of construct search. 
10.1 proportion allocation: using the stratification sampling with proportion allocation we got this expression to sixxe for sample in case of population case: n= n0/1+no/N with n0= Σh=1**H Whph(1-ph)/V where V is the variance for minimun desire for estimate the proportion by population. This variance is on function for the margin of error "d" of value  of normal table. In case doens't calculate V= (d/ζ α/2)**2 
10.2 neyman Optimal allocation: in the same case we do on neyman allocation to average and for the total, we can do this for proportion. In this case, the sample weight need to do with function variability for each strata. So, we got this expression for calculus for sixxe at sample at neyman optimal allocation: n= n0/ 1+ 1/NV Σh=1**H Whph(1-ph) with n0= Σh=1**H Wh**2ph(1-ph)/V Again, the formula from n and n0 could be closer but this not happen because we have the computacional terms more effect to work separate. 
example 1: this search about domestic work were doing by company. The idea is create two stratas, one for male gender(strata1) and another for female gender (strata2). Exists 200 women and 300 men in this enterprise. It were asked if the person do domestic works. The seard done with 110 individuals are proportion way and the result were 25 men said him does domestic works, besides that women were 20. Which is proportion for employees who did domestic work? the answer is the proportion 40% of employees. The population total is N=N1+N2= 300+200=500 The total sample i n=110 the proportion of strata 1 is p1=25/66 = 0,38 and p2=20/44 =0,45 The sample weight wh of each strata is wh=Nh/N with w1=300/500=0,6 and w2=200/500 = 0,4 The estimate of proportion is given by: pestr= Σi=1**N Nhph/N = Σi=1**N whph= 0,6*0,38+0,4*0,45=0,40 so the proportion of employees are do physics exercises is 40% at company. 
exmaple 2:  the town of sao paulo desires estimate the total salary for employees with some companies of determine region. It was created 3 stratas according the sixxe of comany. Strata 1: companies with limits 10 employees. Strata 2: companies with upper 10 employees and less 50 employees, strata 3 for employees upper 50 employees. Based on the town hall exists  70 companies for strata 1, 50 companies to strata 2 and 20 companies for strata 3. After that, searched befores it, got s1**2= 40000, s2**2=22500 s3**2=10000. Suposed a standard error 4% and a level of confidence of 95% (=1,96) what is the minimun sixxe for sample estimate of total income of neyman optimal allocation? n=63 companies. First  find the variance V=(d/ ζ**α /2 ) =(0,04/1,96)**2 = 0.0004 So, we got this expression for calculte the sixxe the sample of neyman optimal allocation: n= Σh=1**H Nhsh/ V+Σh=1**H Nhsh**2 = (70*200)**2 + (50*150)**2 + (20*100)**2/ 0,0004+(70*200**2+50**2+ 20*100**2) = 62,12 Rounded this, we find 63 companies for sample sixxe. So the correct is 63 
To find in all this part, is possible to undertsand the method os  stratification sample, this way to construct the strata and how this could helps the result of search. First of all, we discuss the fundamental concept of simple stratified sampling, that mena the stratified allow the construct stratas and after that each strata could be select sampling by the way of simple random sampling. The second part, presentedn the statistics tools for estimate the quantity of interested. Learning how to estimate the total and the average of the stratified sample, and estimate the variance of this measure. Besides that, distributed the sample of stratas, that means the sample allocation. We see the share of some uniform way, proportional or the neyman optimal, that means the last case who guarantee the more precision of results. To conclude we search the estimate proportions in case of stratified sampling, it determine the search of focus in quantity variables coul be more interested for all quantity variables. Another subject if important to understand the calculus of sample sixxe  for all estimated. We know the expressions using to define the sample of total estimate total, average, proportion and the allocation could affect this dimension. Understand the importance of this stratified and how to do this estimated for various interested.
