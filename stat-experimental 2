PART 2
## introductory sampling methods
using the sampling random simple with and without replacement to estimate the quantityof interesr, estimate the all average, total proportion, the sixxe of sample necesary to that calculations.
about it: technique to sample random simple.
preparation:  1. identify the selection from sample random simple. 2.e the teory and the distribution of average and result from sample rancom simple. 3. identificy the sample, expressions and calculate the estimate from variables of proportion.
with replacement, the sample will select by one this time/ without replacement: the unit will select one time.
## Sample random simple: 2 ways:
with replacement: the samples will select more one time, 
without replacement: when the units couldn't select more one time: example bingo, mega sena.
## method to select units: to sumarisse 1‚â§ n ‚â§(N-1) .
Its so important to select with base in subjectives facts, by chance or random. 
## to using the random simple you need list or register to make one repository.
For exception using the method to select unit could be difficult for bigger population which lives separates each other. for using this method without replacement could affect the result.
2. Probability to select: the sixxe of sample is n equals n/N.
If you select more, the probability increase. So if you chosse 10/12 peoples the probability incresing, otherwise if you select just one descrease.
3. Sample space: the same sixxe n with the N elements to population represents by S. 
4. Combination: that represents on function n and N so: C N,n: (Nn) = N!/ (N-n)!n!
4.1 In case selection without replacement: find the samples availables, means S= C N,n. One sample is different from another, as AB ‚â† AM but AB = BA.   s = C N,n = C=12,2= N!/ (N-n)!n! = 12!/ (12-2)!2!= 12!/10!2!=66
4.2 With replacement: with replacement using S=Nn. So, this case is like n=2 (AA), (AB),...(BB), (BA).. So that expectation will be like S=Nn = 12 the power of 2 = 144. So that repetition N=12 (population sixxe), class element n=2 (sixx of samples)
examples: how many Combination you could do if play 6 numbers, amon 1 and 60, and hit 6 numbers exactly? the answer is C 60,6= 60!/(60-6)! 6! = 60!/54!6! = 50063860. The sample space is S=50 million different possible play. If you play in megasena 1 among 50 million you got the 1/150063860. The result will be 0,0000000199 ~0,00000199%
example 2: the population sixx N is 105 differents combination with samples in 2 sixxe, based on sample simple random without replacement. Which one is the population sixxe? answer: S= CN,n = CN,2 = 105 = N!/(N-2)!2! = 105.2! = N!/(N-2)! = 210 = N!/(N-2)!. Using the factorial idea: N!=N(N-1).(N-2)! So, 210=N(N-1)(N-2)!/(N-2)! cut off (N-2)!, we have 210=N(N-1) = N2-N-210=0. Bhaskara: N=-14 e N=15. So the right one is N=15 based on sample sixxe 2 done 105 different combination. 
PART 2.1: 
1. Notation with common language: 
1.2 Universe or population for select register (N): that's the list where the samples are select
1.3 Sample(N): Set unit to select and observe.
1.4 Parameter: a fix characteristic and unknown which some population have an interested to know. Example: average, proportion, variation, growth tax, total etc.
1.5 Estimator: expressions from amth to some process of calculus and estimates
1.6 Estimates: the greek letter or latin letter uppercase  represents parameter of population. Latin letter lowercase represent characteristic of samples.
population average: Œº = ‚àë N i=1 Yi/ N  sample average: y =  Œ£ N i=1 Yi/ n
Notes: greek letter or latin letter in uppercase using for population parameter X latin letter lowercase using if you are interested in sample 
Population: average = Œº variation: ùúé¬≤ total: T 
sample: average= ùë•ÃÖ variation= s¬≤ Total= T
2. Sample distribution: using the variable x, so the sample n elements are composed by subset x1, x2, ... xn. You can use for know the frequency, and calculate Statistic. Observe yo know every sample or distribution of frequency are composed by element creat differents Statistics.  One sample, one average. 
2.1 Sample distribution of average: only sample had your average, so the distribution is the frequency of S average. That distribution had the name distribution sample of average. One sample is possible  to know the income average indicated in one line, not necesary identical the average of population studies.
- If the sixxe of sample increase, the trend of average of sample are concentrated on 2600-2800. Which content the real population equal 2.675,00. That inference are closing on the real value of incresce the sixxe sample. // The sixxe are bigger sample, it'll shows the distribution of average close on the normal distribution. 
Whats the meaning of normal distribution? Named Gaugassiana, function f(x) when it determine the normal distribution.
f(x) = 1/‚àö2œÄ e -(x-Œº)2/ 2ùúé¬≤   /// average = Œº variation: ùúé¬≤ any value: x
2.2 Estimation : for a proposal the inference is proposal among estima values for parameter. So average, total, variation and other stat. 
Using * for estimate, and one variable has variance too. 
2.3 Variance, standard deviation and coefficient of variation: the variance is the quadratic measure, variation: ùúé¬≤ and sample: s2
sy2 = 1/n-1 ‚àë n i=1 (yi -y)2 and standard deviation: dp = ‚àö s2y = s
standart error: Ep= ‚àö V(y)
The coefficient of variant using with relative dispersion or standart error. COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION: CV = ùúé/Œº
2.4 Estimation of populacional average: Œº= ‚àë N i=1 Yi/ N2
Estimation of populacional average with replacement: y= ‚àë n i=1 Yi/ n
2.5 Estimation total of population: T = ‚àë N i=1 Yi= (Y1 + Y2 + ... Yn)
examples: estimate total of population with or without replacement: T= N ‚àë n i=1Yi/ n means t=Ny || t= 200 . 2,7 t= 1540
2.6 Estimation of variance from estimator from populacional average:  estimator of variance from estimator of populacional average with replacement: V(y)= s2y/n
Estimator of Variance of Estimator of populacional average: V= (y) = (1/n - 1/N) || Both cases we need to find the first: s2y = 1/n-1 ‚àë n i=1(yi-y)
Examples: 2 samples are select from two differents weight of population of city. The first is y=80 kg e s2y= 81 kg2, the second one is y=85 kg s2y=64. If you compare the sample B CV=0,09 e the sample A shows CV=0,11 so the sample B is more homogeneous.CV(A)= sa/ya = 9/80 = 0,11 = 11% / CV(b)= sb/yb= 8/86 = 0.09 = 9%. The B with the lower CV is more homogeneous.
Examples2:  Population with N=50, sample n=7 individual. The result were 15,16,15,14,16,15,14. Which is Estimates for average age and standard error with replacement? y=15 e Es= 0,30 | Sixxe sample n=7, N=100 with replacement. y= ‚àëni=1Yi/n y= (15+16+15+14+16+15+14)/7= 15 years. Estimator of variance is the estimator of average V(y) = sy2/n we need to find sy2= 1/n-1‚àën i=1(yi-y)2 = s2y= 1/6[(15-15)2 + (15-15)2 + (14-15)2 + (16-15 )2 + (15-15)2 + (14-15)2] = sy2 = V (y)= 4/6/7 e Es= ‚àö v(y) = 0.30


PART 2.2: 
PART 2.2: estimator the proportion: to observe in some studies isn't easy to see the proportion of some specif characteristic for example the proportion which enterprise stops during pandemic at 2020. The variable of proportion is define by the number of units of certain population in some characteristic, divids by the number of unit at the same population. The denominator is always the same number of units and the result of proportion will be always 1 and 0, could represent some percentage. We have the interest to understand the unit of population which are at the same category.
y1= 1 if i have a characteristic / 0 if i have not a characteristic. 
1. Population proportion: p= 1/N ‚àë N i=1 Yi=Y' || Estimator of populacional proportion(Sample proportion): ÀÜp=1/n ‚àë n i=1 yi=y'|| Variance of estimator proportion: V(p)= (N-n/ N-1) P(1-P)/n
Estimator of variance of estimator of proportion: V(p)= (N-n/N) p(1-p/n-1) || standard Error of estimator of variance estimator proportion: Ep= ‚àöV(p)
For this expressiona add yi=1 for each indi and divide from the result. P= 100/1000=0,1=10% || The reposition n=100 could be for person. So in this proportion p=8/100=0,08 =8%  || That difference we named standard error. To find the estimator of variance to estimator this proportion V(p) = (N-n/N) p(1-p)/n-1 = V(p) = (1000-100/1000) 0,08.0,92/99 = 0,9*0,00074 = 0,000669
2. Sixxe of sample: the minimun sixxe happen when someone need this for estimator. The sixxe of sample aren't linear. Althought the bigger population aren't necessary the bigger sample. homogeneous or Heterogenous are both more important if you have some subject with more variability and more sample. Though, if the population are more homogeneous which variability will be smaller and the sixx of sample could be smaller too. The most important point is the variability because we dont need colect a bigger sample all characteristic or smilar opinions.
 The sample could offer a really good ne information for estimator some populacional variance. Which is the minimun sixxe of sample? Check the budge. E: maximum distance tolerance among estimate the true value and the paramet (accept absolut error)  | Œ±: probability this distance could be bigger than the E value. The more commom is a alfa(Œ±) 5%, so we got the confidance of 95% with this search ( normal distribution we got = 1.96)
2.1 Sixxe of sample for estimate the average and the populacional total, using this: n= X21 - Œ±/2. N/s2/X21- Œ±/2. s2+ N. E2 
When this sixxe of population be bigger or we didn't have the infinite value, using: n=21-Œ±/2. s2/ E2 | | n = sixxe of sample X= multiple detour pattern of normal distribution table N= sixxe of population s2= variance of parameter to search E= absolut error admit
Ex1: If we fix the maximum error of 5kWh and the confidence level 95% what is the sixxe of minimun sample consider Sample random simple? before the result was s=70kWh / using X95%=1,96 / n= X21- Œ±/2.s¬≤/E2 = 1,96¬≤*70¬≤/5¬≤= 752,95 = 753
2.2 Sixxe for sample estimator a proportion by sample random simple: n = X¬≤Œ±.N.P(1-P)/ X¬≤Œ±P(1-P)+(N-1) E¬≤  || or if the population be bigger or infinite consider: n= X¬≤Œ±P(1-P) E¬≤ | n = sixxe of sample X = pattern detour multiple P = proportion of variable E= absolut error standard
2.3 Sixxe for sample estimator a proportion with unknown proportion:  P(1-P) || n= X¬≤Œ± /4E¬≤
Example1: one search will analyse a variable about enterprises and the governament incentive. What is the sixxe of sample assume the precision of 3% and the confidence 95%? n= 1745 / n = X2Œ± / 4E2 = 1,96 ¬≤/ 4. 0,03¬≤ = n=1067,11
Example2: to estimate some rent houses, the medium value and others datas related with the problem who lives in rent houses. Which sixxe of sample is necesary to know this district had 1980 was 20%? To know the problem has the relative error E=0,05 and confidence coefficient 95%. n=676 families // n=  X¬≤ùúé. N. P(1-P)/ X¬≤ùúé.
