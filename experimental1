# types of searching
A - tranversal cross (cross sectiona): 1. one occasion 2. state of population 3. one sample 4. interview one unit
B - Rotating panel: 1. a lot of ocasion 2. evolution of population 3. to each occasion changes the sample 4. generally one interview for unit
C - Panel study: 1. a lot of occasion 2. evolutionof unit 3. the same sample on occasion 4. a lot of interview for unit
## transversal searching: happens one occasion for only one event. Thats import to understand the state of population in a specif time, so one unit will be interview one time
## searching transversal repetition: data from differents time, the same variables. That search have to do again, and again. Ex: understand the population increase.
## longitudinal searching: one person from differents occasion collect. In that we can test strong relations, for example using medicine for diabette and how long ti will be necessary to someone. 
Which one did you chose? If the object is to analyse the effect just for one time, choose the tranversal. If you need analyse some cicle, have to be the searching transversal repetition. Otherwise for searching longitudinal thats gonna be more then one occasion with all people.
step by step for searching: define the goal, concepts and resource
## obtain and evaluation of registration: register helps with information, planning of sample or helps to estimate the results.
## plan, select, control sample:
- collect with two way: direct or undirect. If it's gonna be direct collect, it'll be with the continue  method, periodical, casual.
- collect undirectly
# Estimation with quantity of interest: 
## Avaliation of quality Estimation with precision
define the goals, conecpts, chosse the right techincal to collect, construct and test the survey, collect the data, process the data, analyse OR population chose the techincal to collect, draw and select the sample, colect the data, process data, estimate
## 2
## addiction deliberate
the question have to be neutral, specially with searching opinion and attitudes. 
## non intentional addiction: when the problem happen with no intentional question. 
## desire to please: social desirable, 
# unecessary complex: not be more complex with the questions on survey 
## confidentiality and anonymity: secrecy law, disidentification
## 3 distinguish between probabilistic and non probabilistic sample selection methods and sampling types
statistical data collection methods
example demographic cesus
studies population smaller
maximum precision
allos the construction of register
sampling: this area influence by inference// descriptive Statistics of probabilities
samples error and non samples: the error is so important// non samples which happen when the difference between the sample and parameter population.
the result of sample are estimate by population. the sample error is the differencebetween the real result(all population) and the estimate sample. 
## Advantages and recommedation of sample: 
lower cost, one part of population with all population census. so the eveidence the lower coust sample
higher speed: the sample needs to reflects of time to collect because the resuts could change after a long period.
controlled precision: the sixxe of sample could affect the coust and the time.
collection load reduction: if you reduction the load the consequences of time and coust will reduce. so less question, less coust.
specialixxed needs: the sample will attend specific point to analyse. Which affect the plan of sample, not everyone but just girls or boys.
## types of sample: probabilistic or non probabilistic//
1. probabilistic sample: Selection probabilities incorporated in population estimates
It means that, when we are going to calculate estimates of interest, a total or an average for example, the value of the selection probability of that unit will be taken into account.
2. Known and Calculable Selection Probabilities
Given that we will select an individual from the sample, the probability that he will be part of the research must be something known, that is, it has to be something that could have been calculated. It is impossible to select an individual for a survey if he does not have a known selection probability.
3. Every unit of the population has > 0 probability of being chosen
Fundamental condition for a probabilistic sample, as all units must have a probability greater than zero. It may be a tiny value, but it still cannot be zero.
4. allow statistical inference only in probability sampling is possible to makearion for the population, we named this step statistical inference
###
1. simple random sampling: with reposition the elements or not reposition
2. sampling stratified: estrats or a process named stratified for one group select the sample with simple or randim selection. this division are finding homogeneous between some characteristic, or stratified for stratified with another aspect.

3. sampling by conglomerates: divide with stages and the selection will be by one stage.
4. systematic sampling: the first element will select randomic. which systematic select the sample by x by x regular units.
## non probabilistic sampling: 
1. sampling with convenience: select the element avaiables. that selection for sample unit will be doer by interviewer.
2. intentional sampling: that one focus on goals and how the population could be affect each other. Results and biased.
3. snowball sampling: the random will affect in the begin and the end are non probabilistic. they will grow up
4. quotas sampling: one characteristic will be implement to do the seach.
